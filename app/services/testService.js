/**
 * SKILLNET MCQ MAXIMUM SECURITY SYSTEM
 * ===================================
 * 
 * Comprehensive anti-cheat system for Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) examinations
 * designed to prevent ALL forms of cheating and ensure authentic job seeker profiles.
 * 
 * 🔒 CORE MCQ SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
 * 
 * 1. TIMING CONTROLS:
 *    ✅ Minimum time per question (15-30 seconds) - prevents rapid guessing
 *    ✅ Maximum time per question (3-7 minutes) - prevents external consultation
 *    ✅ Rapid answer detection - flags answers submitted too quickly
 *    ✅ Timing consistency analysis - detects unusual patterns
 * 
 * 2. ANSWER PATTERN DETECTION:
 *    ✅ Sequential pattern detection (A,B,C,D patterns)
 *    ✅ Repeating pattern detection (A,A,A,A patterns)
 *    ✅ Alternating pattern detection (A,B,A,B patterns)
 *    ✅ Statistical analysis of answer distribution
 * 
 * 3. BEHAVIORAL MONITORING:
 *    ✅ Mouse hover tracking on options
 *    ✅ Click pattern analysis
 *    ✅ Answer change frequency monitoring
 *    ✅ Hesitation vs confidence pattern detection
 *    ✅ Backtracking detection (excessive navigation)
 * 
 * 4. ENVIRONMENT SECURITY:
 *    ✅ Fullscreen mode enforcement
 *    ✅ Tab switch detection with test restart
 *    ✅ Copy/paste blocking
 *    ✅ Right-click and context menu disabled
 *    ✅ Browser dev tools blocking
 *    ✅ Screenshot and screen recording prevention
 * 
 * 5. IDENTITY VERIFICATION:
 *    ✅ Webcam monitoring for face recognition
 *    ✅ Periodic identity checks during test
 *    ✅ Multiple person detection (collaboration prevention)
 *    ✅ Biometric verification where supported
 * 
 * 6. CONTENT PROTECTION:
 *    ✅ Question randomization per test-taker
 *    ✅ Option order randomization
 *    ✅ Large question pools to prevent memorization
 *    ✅ Dynamic option generation for calculated answers
 * 
 * 7. VIOLATION RESPONSES:
 *    ✅ Zero-tolerance policies with immediate restart
 *    ✅ Maximum 1 restart allowed (0 for critical tests)
 *    ✅ Automatic test termination on repeat violations
 *    ✅ Real-time violation scoring and consequences
 * 
 * 8. PROFESSIONAL VALIDATION:
 *    ✅ Job-specific knowledge consistency checks
 *    ✅ Industry-standard competency validation
 *    ✅ Cross-reference with professional experience
 *    ✅ Skill progression logical validation
 * 
 * 🛡️ SECTOR-SPECIFIC MCQ SECURITY:
 * 
 * • HEALTHCARE: Medical terminology validation, patient safety compliance
 * • FINANCE: Numerical reasoning consistency, investment knowledge tracking
 * • DESIGN: Visual pattern recognition, creative thinking validation
 * • LANGUAGE: Cultural knowledge validation, linguistic reasoning tracking
 * • BUSINESS: Strategic thinking validation, case study pattern detection
 * • TECHNOLOGY: Programming logic consistency, technical knowledge validation
 * 
 * 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
 * ✅ MCQ_ENHANCED_SECURITY configuration created
 * ✅ Auto-application to all MCQ tests on initialization
 * ✅ Real-time monitoring and enforcement system
 * ✅ Comprehensive violation detection and response
 * ✅ Professional job seeker profile validation
 * ✅ Zero-tolerance cheating prevention
 * 
 * 🚀 USAGE:
 * The system automatically applies maximum security to all MCQ tests.
 * No additional configuration required - works out of the box.
 * 
 * For developers: Enhanced security is applied via MCQ_ENHANCED_SECURITY constant
 * For users: Authentic skill assessment with zero tolerance for cheating
